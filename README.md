# interview-algorithms

Workspace to practice solving fundamental interview problems and improving knowledge of algorithms and complexity.

## Purpose

I am aware that interviewing is difficult and having the skillset is not sufficient if you cannot prove that you know how to code. This is an attempt at improving my knowledge of algorithms, runtime analysis, and problem solving while also prepping for interviews.

## Approach

I will be employing a test driven development (TDD) approach to solving problems. I will be using Jest to write unit tests for the various functions/problems I wish to attempt to solve, and then write the solution that satisfies all the test criteria.
